# Module: uniterra-systemprompt

**Purpose:** pi-agent extension that appends the app-wide working rules to every agent turn's system prompt via a `before_agent_start` handler.

Source: `packages/uniterra-systemprompt/src/index.ts`; tests `test/general.test.mjs`.

## Registration

- `package.json` exposes `"pi": { "extensions": ["./src/index.ts"] }`.
- The entry is a **default-exported factory** `generalExtension(pi: ExtensionAPI)` — pi's loader requires `jiti.import(path, { default: true })` then `typeof factory === 'function'`. This is the single platform exception to the no-default-exports rule.
- Handler: `pi.on('before_agent_start', (event) => ({ systemPrompt: event.systemPrompt + '\n\n' + WORKING_RULES }))` — stateless rebuild from `event.systemPrompt`, so rules stay active all session with no cross-turn duplication (locked by test).

## Working Rules

Appended to every turn:

| #   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 2   | Thinking has a cost: reason only as far as needed to set direction, then stop and act — no thinking in circles, no re-deriving settled conclusions; when in doubt, verify with evidence                                                                                                                      |
| 3   | Work in an **infer-verify-correct** loop: (1) reason to a conclusion or hypothesis, (2) test it against the real system (run code, read files, execute tests, query APIs), (3) correct the conclusion from the evidence — a conclusion the evidence contradicts is a dropped hypothesis, not a defended fact |
| 4   | Keep replies concise: state the essentials — outcome, evidence, next step — no filler, no restating the question, no process recap                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 12  | When you start a background tool (a background subagent or job), start it and then STOP — wait for the completion notification, do not poll or sleep-wait to burn tokens; use the time for independent work, else end your turn and let the notification wake you                                            |

## Test Guarantees

- `before_agent_start` handler is registered.
- Output starts with the base prompt and includes rules 1, 10, 11 verbatim.
- The thinking-cost framing (rules 2–3), the concise-output rule (4), and the background-tool no-poll rule (12) are asserted by dedicated tests.
- Running the handler twice yields identical output with exactly one occurrence of each rule (no accumulation).

## Dependencies

- Outbound: `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (types + `ExtensionAPI`).
- Inbound: none in-repo (consumed by the pi runtime via the `pi.extensions` manifest).

## Patterns & Gotchas

- Keep the factory default-exported and the filename `src/index.ts` — pi's loader contract.
- Rules live here only; `AGENTS.md` mirrors the falsifiable subset for human agents.

## How to Update

- Rule added/changed → edit `WORKING_RULES`, extend the test, run `pnpm run build` (desktop consumes the built `dist` export).

## Find It Fast

```bash
grep -n 'WORKING_RULES' packages/uniterra-systemprompt/src/index.ts
```
