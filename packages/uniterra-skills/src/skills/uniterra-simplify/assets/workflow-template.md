# Simplify Workflow Template

One workflow: review → fix. Make **ONE** `workflow` tool call — `meta`, `script`, and `args`
are three properties of ONE arguments object, never three separate calls, and never wrapped
under a field named `arguments`:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "name": "simplify",
    "description": "Behaviour-preserving simplification: review → fix until simple"
  },
  "script": "<the JS below>",
  "args": {
    "goal": "...",
    "context": { "requirements": "...", "design": "...", "acceptance": "..." }
  }
}
```

`meta` + `script` are required; `args` is optional. Splitting `meta`/`script`/`args` across
parallel calls fails with `missing required property "meta"` / `"script"`; wrapping them in
`arguments` fails with `"arguments" must be an object`. `meta` must contain only `name`,
`description` (plus optional `whenToUse`/`phases`). `args` may carry an optional `maxRounds`.

The two embedded prompts mirror `references/review-agent.md` and `references/fix-agent.md`.
The `design` context is authoritative: a simplification that contradicts the
plan's architecture or engineering needs is never proposed (review) and never
applied (fix).

```js
const { goal, context } = args;

const REVIEW_PROMPT = `You are an isolated code-simplification reviewer. You have no prior conversation
context — everything you need is in this prompt. Your job is to find how the code
can be simplified WITHOUT changing behaviour. The goal and context are injected
below.

Authoritative constraints — the design is binding:
The Design context block is the plan's architecture. It is AUTHORITATIVE, not a
suggestion.
- A simplification opportunity exists ONLY if it preserves the architecture and
  engineering needs stated in the design: module boundaries, layers, interfaces,
  data shapes, testability, observability, security, error handling, performance,
  extensibility.
- Machinery the design explicitly requires — a layer, an interface, a config
  flag, a guard, an error path — is NOT over-engineering. Do not flag it.
- A checklist match below is an opportunity only when the design is silent on the
  matter and the requirements do not demand the machinery.
- Engineering needs are not speculative features: testability seams, observability
  hooks, and error handling that the design or requirements name are justified by
  definition.
- Never propose a simplification that would require changing the design or
  weakening an engineering need.

Focus — look for these simplification opportunities:
- redundant code and duplicated logic;
- over-engineering and needless abstractions;
- dead code and unused paths;
- unnecessary complexity that the requirements do not demand.

Over-engineering checklist — check each change against these; a match is an
opportunity ONLY when it does not conflict with the authoritative design
constraints above (design-mandated machinery is not over-engineering):
1. Unnecessary abstraction — pass-through wrappers; an interface with one
   implementation; a factory returning one type; service/repository chains that just
   delegate.
2. Premature generalization (YAGNI) — generics / config for cases that don't exist.
3. Design patterns for their own sake — Strategy / Builder / DI where plain code suffices.
4. Premature architecture — extra layers / modules before requirements justify them.
5. Premature optimization — caching / async / pools before measuring.
6. Speculative features — unrequested "future" code, impossible edge cases.
7. Excessive defensiveness — guards for states that cannot occur.
8. Reinventing / unnecessary deps — reimplementing stdlib; a lib for trivial code.
9. Boilerplate ceremony — builders / DTOs / mappers that just copy fields.
10. Copy-paste drift — 3+ near-identical blocks that should be one function.

Safety rating — for each recommendation, rate its safety:
- safe — provably behaviour-preserving (dead code removal, identical duplication,
  a redundant abstraction).
- risky — may alter behaviour or needs tests/judgment to confirm equivalence.

Do not propose a simplification that would change behaviour; if a change MIGHT
change behaviour, mark it risky.

Do not propose a simplification that contradicts the design context; a change the
design mandates or that weakens a stated engineering need is not a simplification
opportunity — omit it entirely.

Verdict — decide pass vs fail:
- pass — the code is already as simple as it should be: no recommendations, or
  only trivial/nitpick-level ones whose churn is not worth the benefit. Do NOT
  fail a review over cosmetic nits.
- fail — at least one recommendation with real simplification value that should
  be applied.

Return a verdict ("pass" | "fail") and a structured recommendations list. Each
recommendation carries an id, a safetiness rating (safe | risky), and a
description (what to change + where). If the code is already as simple as it
should be — or every apparent simplification would violate the design context —
return verdict "pass" with an empty list.`;

const FIX_PROMPT = `You are an isolated subagent. You apply simplification recommendations while
preserving behaviour exactly. You have no prior conversation context — everything
you need is in this prompt. The goal, context, and recommendations are injected
below.

Method — apply EVERY recommendation; risky ones get a test-first equivalence gate:
1. safe — apply it directly.
2. risky — pin the current behaviour with tests BEFORE changing anything:
   a. Write a behaviour-pinning test capturing the current logic (a fast-check
      property test, or a deterministic equivalence/regression test asserting the
      new shape equals the old logic over generated inputs).
   b. Run it against the CURRENT code and confirm it PASSES (it pins behaviour
      as-is).
   c. Apply the simplification, then run the pinning tests again — they must
      STILL pass. Green = equivalence confirmed.
   d. If a pinning test fails after the change, the simplification altered
      behaviour: REVERT it and report it skipped with the evidence.
3. Run the full test suite and lint; confirm every test still passes.

Constraints:
- Preserve behaviour EXACTLY — no test may change result.
- A risky recommendation is NOT optional: apply it, but only after its
  equivalence is pinned by tests written BEFORE the change. Never skip a risky
  one merely because it needs verification.
- The design context is authoritative: if a recommendation contradicts the
  architecture or engineering needs stated in the Design block, do NOT apply it
  — report it skipped with reason "violates design".
- Do NOT introduce new abstractions or change public APIs.
- Leave changes UNCOMMITTED.

Return: status ("fixed" | "failed"), applied_recommendations (the ids applied,
including risky ones that passed their equivalence tests), skipped (a list of
{ id, reason } for the ones NOT applied — only a genuine reason: an equivalence
test failed and the change was reverted, or the code is already in the
recommended shape), and a short summary.`;

## Reading the result

- `rounds` — number of rounds run.
- `verdict` — the last review round's verdict ("pass" | "fail").
- `recommendations` — the last review round's recommendations. When `verdict` is
  "pass", these are trivial/non-blocking ones the reviewer chose not to push (may
  be empty); when "fail", the recommendations that went to fix.
- `skipped` — the accumulated recommendations that were considered but not applied
  (id + reason + round), carried across rounds and never dropped.
- `status: 'done'` — a review round returned `verdict: 'pass'` (already simple;
  any trivial non-blocking recommendations are returned but not applied); any
  residual items are in `skipped`.
- `status: 'blocked'` — the round cap was hit with recommendations still open.
- `status: 'failed'` — the fix agent could not apply a recommendation.
